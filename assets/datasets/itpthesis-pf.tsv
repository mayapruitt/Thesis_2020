person	person	Certain personal characteristics are sometimes associated with creativity, such as attraction to complexity, intuition, and risk taking, but having such traits doesn't guarantee creative achievement. Instead creativity is usually a result of the combination of these traits with task motivation and domain-relevant skills. 	When studying creativity from a person perspective, creative people are asked to self-report their creative abilities or products. This type of measurement, while the most common, is likely to be innaccurate because people often under-report or over-report their own creative achievements. This has contributed greatly to reasons why we ask domain experts, or other people in general to judge creativity instead.

person	inspiring	It is important not to overgeneralize culture, but previous studies have shown an interesting dichotomy between Eastern and Western perspectives on creativity. Participants were asked to name what qualities describe creative people. Though Eastern and Western participants shared descriptors such as "original" and "imaginative", characteristics such as "inspires people", "makes contributions to society", "is appreciated by others", "opinionated", and "rebellious" were uniquely listed by Eastern participants.

process	process	One important cognitive process conducive to creativity is referred to as divergent thinking, or the ability to follow a variety of different trains of thought which sometimes leads to innovation. It is a misnomer that some people are born with creativity and others are not, because skills like divergent thinking can be practiced and improved!

process	many responses	Psychologist J.P. Guilford created the Alternative Uses Task (which you performed earlier in this experiment) to measure one's creativity by their ability to ideate and think about exisiting things differently. One metric used for scoring is "fluency", meaning the higher number of responses the higher the score in this area. This is sometimes considered a flaw of this test, because "the person who is capable of producing a large number of ideas per unit of time, other things being equal, has a greater chance of having significant ideas".

process	detail of responses	One metric used to score the Alternative Uses Task is "elaboration" meaning the detail of responses. Paricipants are given more points for a response like: "using a brick to prop open a door from a strong gust of wind" versus "a doorstop".

product	idea	The standard definition of creativity is "requiring originalness and effectiveness". This seems to apply most directly to creative products or responses. Creativity researcher, Dr. Teresa Amabile, describes that its not enough for products to be unusual, statistically infrequent, or completely unique, they must also be fit into the context of the problem they were designed for or meet the needs of the audience it addresses. Do you agree with this idea?

product	specific	If a specific use stood out to you among the entire list, you are taking a product-based perspective on creativity. This could mean that rather than the person, the creative outcomes are more important to your evaluation of creativity. 	
product	unsual	If you chose a list for because the uses that felt very unique, you might value the originality or novelty of creative products. Interestingly, in studies of how culture affects evaluations of creativity, Western cultures tend to place greater importance on originality than usefulness.	
product	unique	If you chose a list for because the uses that felt very unique, you might value the originality or novelty of creative products. Interestingly, in studies of how culture affects evaluations of creativity, Western cultures tend to place greater importance on originality than usefulness.	
product	surprising	"Some theorists define creativity in terms of the response that the product produces in an observer. For example, Bruner(1962) saw the creative product as anything that produces ‘effective surprise’ in the observer, along with a ‘shock of recognition’ that the product or response is, although novel, is entirely appropriate” (Amabile, 1982)	
product	effective	If you chose a list for because the uses that felt well...useful, you might value the effectiveness or appropriateness of creative products. Interestingly, in studies of how culture affects evaluations of creativity, Eastern cultures tend to place greater importance on usefulness than originality.

press	context	If you chose a list because of how the uses seem to fit into a current time or greater context, you are thinking a lot about creativity from a press perspective, meaning how the relationship of the creativity to its greater context. The role of environment in creativity goes both ways: creativity can be suited to a certain domain or certain domains can be more conducive to producing creativity. For example school environments with ample physical space, availability of various materias, game-based approaches, and supportive teacher-student relationships are said to enhace creativity (Davies et al., 2013)	Included in the idea of creative envrionments are motivations. Intrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from within. It is believed that if a person believes engaging in a task will be personally valuable, the task is conducive to creativity.However, extrinsic motivations, or outside motivation like the promise of rewards, praise, threat of failure, or bad criticism can be detrimental to creativity. (Amabile &. Pillemer, 2012)

press	contributes to society	Researchers often describe Eastern cultures as "collectivist", meaning the culture emphasizes creativity that contributes to the progress of society (Hempel & Sue-Chan, 2010).
